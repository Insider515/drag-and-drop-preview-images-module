/**
 * The little bit of HTTP the upload endpoint needs, without a framework.

 * not a general router: the routes are fixed paths with no parameters, so
 * matching is a lookup on `method + pathname` and nothing more.
 *
 * The handler it produces has the signature `(req, res, next)`, which is also
 * exactly what Express accepts as middleware. One function serves both worlds,
 * and Express stops being a dependency at all.
